- **Nutrition Calculations**: Daily and weekly nutrition summaries with recommendations
- **Daily Intake Logging**: Timeline-based food consumption tracking

### Frontend (React + TypeScript + Material-UI)
- **User Interface**: Clean design inspired by structured.app and MacroFactor
- **Daily Overview**: Timeline view for adding and managing food entries
- **Nutrition Dashboard**: Visual representation of nutrient intake vs recommendations

- **TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)**: BMR × Activity Level
- **Goal Adjustment**: Calorie adjustment based on weight goals
- **Macronutrient Distribution**: Protein, carbs, and fat recommendations
- **Micronutrient Requirements**: Based on dietary reference intakes

## Frontend Code Refactoring Achievements

The frontend codebase has undergone a comprehensive refactoring to improve code readability, maintainability, and modularity. The goal was to reduce file sizes under 300 lines where possible and extract reusable components.

### Refactoring Results

**Total Lines Saved: 2,044 lines across 5 major pages**
**Average File Size Reduction: 58%**

| Page | Before | After | Reduction | Lines Saved |
|------|--------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| HomePage | 958 lines | 514 lines | 46% | 444 lines |
| AdminPage | 771 lines | 451 lines | 41% | 320 lines |
| SearchPage | 678 lines | 257 lines | 62% | 421 lines |
| SettingsPage | 614 lines | 62 lines | 90% | 552 lines |
| TwoWeekIngredientsPage | 476 lines | 169 lines | 64% | 307 lines |

   - Event Handlers
   - Data Fetching
   - CRUD Operations
   - Component Logic

2. **TypeScript Interfaces**: Proper type definitions for all component props and state

3. **Responsive Design**: All extracted components maintain mobile, tablet, and desktop responsiveness

4. **Theme Integration**: Components support custom theme colors and gradient accents

5. **Error Handling**: Preserved all error handling and loading states

6. **Functionality Preservation**: Maintained 100% of original functionality including:
   - Recipe ingredient scaling and timeline display
   - Admin CRUD operations with responsive tables
   - Recipe search and filtering capabilities
   - Theme customization with gradient support
   - Grocery list with purchase state persistence

### Architecture Benefits

- **Modularity**: Components are now reusable across different pages
- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to understand and modify
- **Testing**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
- **Performance**: Potential for lazy loading of modal components
- **Scalability**: Easy to extend functionality without bloating main page files

This refactoring establishes a solid foundation for future development while significantly improving the developer experience through better code organization and comprehensive documentation.

# Todos
   - ~~When updating an entry on the homepage, the date is not passed, which causes an error~~ ✅ Fixed: Added entry_date to update request and created separate validation schema for updates
   - ~~When adding, note is still not optional~~ ✅ Fixed: Notes field now properly allows empty strings and null values
   - ~~Skaling of the ingredients in the add on homepage with size~~ ✅ Fixed: Added automatic ingredient scaling when recipe serving size changes with rescale button
   - ~~hardcode recipe as a serving in the picker when adding a new recipe in the Homepage to avoid unneeded work~~ ✅ Fixed
   - ~~limit ingredients adding on the homepage modal to g and kg~~ ✅ Fixed
   - ~~limit the supplement adding in the homepage mdal to tablet~~ ✅ Fixed
   - ~~Size of admin page table and inputs on mobile (now unusable), the content does not fit on the page, make it smaller or use spacemore efficient on mobile (tablet and web work fine)~~ ✅ Fixed: Completely reworked mobile layout with compact cards, smaller fonts, and space-efficient design while keeping tablet and desktop layouts unchanged
   - ~~home page menu is not really response and should work like the structured on mobile as well found here (https://structured.app/)~~ ✅ Fixed: Improved mobile navigation with centered date display, touch-friendly interface, swipe gestures, and mobile-optimized week navigation
   - ~~Above the ingredients of a recipe after adding a recipe to the homepage, add the recipe in some way (clickable banner or line but keep the current design as untouched as possible) which shows the coocking steps when clicked~~ ✅ Fixed: Added recipe banners that appear as separate entries above recipe ingredients in the timeline, with clickable functionality to view cooking instructions and ingredient list in a modal
   - ~~make the recpie header and Ingredients boxes in generall smaller on mobile to save space (remove th eclick to see coocking instructions text).~~ ✅ Fixed: Optimized mobile layout by removing type chips (since icons already indicate category), moving quantity to same row as item name, and reducing padding/margins for more compact design
   - ~~add a modal to the homepage, that asks you befor deleting an entry.~~ ✅ Fixed: Added confirmation modal that appears before deleting any entry, showing entry details and requiring user confirmation
   - ~~give the recipe header a delet icon to delete all its ingredients.~~ ✅ Fixed: Added delete icon to recipe banners with confirmation modal for bulk deletion of all recipe ingredients
   - ~~fix the serving size in the menu header to reflect the ingredients it represents (get the ingredients from the timeline and not the recipe in the database when clicking the recipe banner).~~ ✅ Fixed: Recipe modal now displays actual consumed quantities from timeline entries instead of database recipe defaults, with serving size showing "Actual consumed (from timeline)" and ingredients labeled as "Ingredients (Actual Consumed)"
   - ~~add a bit more space on the homepgae verticalley between the timeline and the entries.~~ ✅ Fixed: Added significant vertical spacing between timeline elements with mobile-optimized positioning - increased margin-top (3 units) between time indicators and entries, increased margin-bottom (6-8 units) between time slots, and enhanced left margin (7 units on mobile, 8 on desktop) to prevent overlap between circular time indicators and entries
   - ~~add a new page, that gets all the ingredients of the next two weeks, starting from and including the current day. (adding the same ingredients to get one entry, for this info query the intake_entries table, if neccessary write a new endpoint for that)~~ ✅ Fixed: Created "Grocery List" page that aggregates ingredients from the next two weeks, with new backend endpoint for date range queries and proper date handling in mock database
   - ~~add a range picker to the grocery list page which defaults to the values of current date time to two weeks ahead.~~ ✅ Fixed: Added Material-UI date range picker with proper validation, error handling, mobile responsiveness, and default values (current date to two weeks ahead) that automatically refetches data when dates change
   - ~~make the list elements to be clickable and marked as purchased (keep the entry but draw a line through the text), a second click will reverse the change and so on (make those changes and the whole list persistent in storage).~~ ✅ Fixed: Added clickable grocery list items with purchase status toggle, visual indicators (strikethrough, opacity, checkmarks), and persistent storage per date range using localStorage
   - ~~save the data on which ingredient in the grocery list was clicked in the storage for persistenc over page swap or refresh.~~ ✅ Fixed: Enhanced grocery list persistence to intelligently detect ingredient quantity changes and selectively reset purchased status only for modified ingredients while preserving purchased state for unchanged items, with automatic cleanup of outdated storage entries


   - ~~go over the frontend code and improve it readability by adding comments and reducing theline amount under 300 lines per file (if possible,take as many as necessary), achieve this by exporting components (especially the modals, export them from the main page contents and move them to the modal subdirectory) or improving logic, without compromising the current functionality.~~ ✅ **COMPLETED: Enhanced Frontend Code Refactoring**
